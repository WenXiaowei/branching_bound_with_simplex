# Combinatorial and Decision Making Optimization (Module 2)

## [Simplex](simplex/simplex.py)
Given a tableau, find the best assignments to the variables which gives the optimal solution. 
    
## [Knap sack problem](branchingbound_knapsack_problem/knap_sack_problem.py)
Given a list of items, each one with an utility and weight, and a max amount of weight that we can carry, returns a list of items which sum of utility is the maximum possible. 


## [Binary decision problem with Simplex](./branching_bound/branching_bound.py)
It's the combination of the binary decision-making and Linear programming, where given a list of decision variables, and tableau for simplex, we can compute the best combination of binary decision variables to produce a Simplex tableau which result is the optimal for the problem.
